# Test Failures due possible code bugs

## BankAccount.UnitTests.csproj - BankAccount.UnitTests.AccountTests.Withdraw_ValidAmount_DecreasesBalanceAndReturnsUpdated
- **Confidence**: High
- **Test File**: BankAccount.UnitTests\AccountTests.cs
- **Bug Location**: BankAccount\Account.cs@34

### Analysis
The failure occurs inside Account.Deposit. The method updates the Balance with Balance += amount and then returns Balance + amount. Returning Balance + amount effectively doubles the deposit in the returned value and can overflow when amount is very large (e.g. decimal.MaxValue). The test seeds the account by calling Deposit(initial) with decimal.MaxValue which causes an OverflowException when the method attempts to compute Balance + amount. The intended behavior is to return the new balance after the deposit (i.e., the updated Balance), not add the amount again. Therefore the production code is incorrect and must be fixed.

### Suggested Fix
Change Account.Deposit to return the updated Balance after adding the amount. Replace the incorrect return expression `return Balance + amount;` with `return Balance;`. The rest of the method (including the ThrowIfNegativeOrZero check and updating Balance with Balance += amount) is correct. This prevents the incorrect doubling and eliminates the overflow when depositing very large amounts.
